### ðŸ”„ Current Implementation: Session-Specific Export Functionality

#### 5. Export Enhancement - IN PROGRESS ðŸ”„
- [ ] Add session tracking to Streamlit session state
- [ ] Implement file monitoring for current session
- [ ] Create export panel in sidebar with download functionality
- [ ] Add ZIP file creation for session-specific files
- [ ] Display only PNG charts in chat interface
- [ ] Include both PNG and CSV files in export ZIP

### ðŸ“‹ Implementation Plan:

**Files to be Modified:**
- `streamlit.py` - Main enhancement for export functionality

**Key Features to Add:**
1. **Session State Management**:
   - `session_id` - Unique identifier for current chat session
   - `session_start_time` - Timestamp when session started
   - `session_files` - List of files created in current session

2. **File Tracking**:
   - Monitor temp folder before/after analysis
   - Track only files created during current session
   - Filter by creation timestamp and session ID

3. **Export Panel**:
   - "ðŸ“¥ Export Analysis Results" button in sidebar
   - Show file count and types available for export
   - Create ZIP file with session-specific files
   - Streamlit download functionality

4. **Display Logic**:
   - Show PNG charts in chat interface
   - Hide CSV files from chat display
   - Include both PNG and CSV in export ZIP

### ðŸŽ¯ Expected Outcome:
- Users can see only charts generated in current session
- Export button downloads all session files (charts + data)
- Clean separation between different chat sessions
- Professional export functionality with ZIP download

## ðŸš€ Next Steps:
1. Implement session tracking in streamlit.py
2. Add export panel and ZIP creation functionality
