ng# üöÄ Query Clarity Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## üìã Overview
Successfully implemented the **Query Clarity Agent** enhancement to the Analyzer GPT Modular project. This enhancement adds intelligent query analysis that detects vague user queries and provides contextual clarifying questions based on the uploaded CSV data.

## ‚ú® What Was Added

### 1. Query Clarity Agent (`agents/query_clarity_agent.py`)
- **Purpose**: Analyzes user queries to determine if they are clear or vague
- **Functionality**: 
  - Evaluates query clarity using AI
  - Generates 5 contextual clarifying questions for vague queries
  - Uses actual CSV column names and data context
  - Returns structured JSON responses

### 2. Enhanced Streamlit Interface (`streamlit.py`)
- **Left Panel**: Added "Query Suggestions" panel that displays clarifying questions
- **Two-Column Layout**: Main content on right, suggestions on left
- **Interactive Workflow**: 
  - User submits query ‚Üí Clarity check ‚Üí Show suggestions if vague ‚Üí User refines ‚Üí Analysis proceeds
  - Clear queries go directly to analysis
  - Vague queries show suggestions panel

### 3. Workflow Integration
- **Non-Disruptive**: Original Data Analyzer and Code Executor agents remain unchanged
- **Pre-Processing**: Query clarity check happens before the main analysis team
- **Smart Routing**: 
  - Clear queries ‚Üí Direct to analyzer team
  - Vague queries ‚Üí Show suggestions ‚Üí Wait for user refinement

## üîÑ How It Works

### For Clear Queries:
1. User uploads CSV and asks clear question (e.g., "Show me sales trends by month")
2. Query Clarity Agent evaluates ‚Üí "Clear"
3. Proceeds directly to Data Analyzer Team
4. Normal analysis workflow continues

### For Vague Queries:
1. User uploads CSV and asks vague question (e.g., "analyze data")
2. Query Clarity Agent evaluates ‚Üí "Vague"
3. Generates 5 clarifying questions using CSV columns:
   - "Do you want to see sales trends over the 'date' column?"
   - "Would you like profit analysis by 'region'?"
   - "Are you interested in correlations between 'sales' and 'profit'?"
   - etc.
4. Shows suggestions in left panel
5. User clicks on a suggestion
6. Refined query proceeds to analysis

## üéØ Key Features

### Contextual Intelligence
- Uses actual CSV column names in suggestions
- Considers data types and relationships
- Provides actionable clarifying questions

### User Experience
- Clean two-panel interface
- Interactive suggestion buttons
- Clear visual feedback (‚úÖ for clear, ü§î for vague)
- Seamless workflow integration

### Backward Compatibility
- Original analyzer team workflow unchanged
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to core logic

## üìÅ Files Modified/Added

### New Files:
- `agents/query_clarity_agent.py` - Core clarity analysis logic
- `ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:
- `streamlit.py` - Enhanced UI with suggestions panel and workflow integration
- `TODO.md` - Updated to reflect completed enhancement

## üß™ Example Usage

**Vague Query**: "show insights"
**Generated Suggestions**:
1. "Would you like to see summary statistics for sales and profit columns?"
2. "Do you want revenue trends over the date column?"
3. "Are you interested in regional performance analysis?"
4. "Would you like to see correlations between price and quantity?"
5. "Do you want product category breakdowns?"

**Clear Query**: "Create a bar chart showing total sales by product category"
**Result**: Proceeds directly to analysis (no suggestions needed)

## üéâ Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Helps users formulate better queries
2. **Reduced Frustration**: No more failed analyses due to vague queries
3. **Educational**: Users learn what kinds of questions work well
4. **Context-Aware**: Suggestions are specific to their actual data
5. **Non-Intrusive**: Clear queries aren't slowed down by unnecessary steps

## üîß Technical Implementation

- **AI-Powered**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for query evaluation
- **Structured Output**: JSON responses for reliable parsing
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if clarity check fails
- **State Management**: Proper Streamlit session state handling
- **Async Support**: Non-blocking query evaluation

This enhancement successfully addresses the need for better query guidance while maintaining the original project's functionality and performance.
